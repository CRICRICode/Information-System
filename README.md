# Pneuservice Information System

## Overview

This project is a tire management system developed for Pneuservice Ciccone AG. The system currently includes a core function to assign work tasks to employees using a calendar interface. It manages employee schedules efficiently and simplifies task allocation. The system is built with a back-end running on port 8081, a front-end using Angular running on port 4200, and a PostgreSQL database on port 5433.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
> git clone https://github.com/CRICRICode/Information-System cd pneuservice

### 2. Set Up the Database
The system uses PostgreSQL for database management. Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and configured properly.

- PostgreSQL Port: 5433
- Database Setup: Create a new database and update the necessary credentials in the configuration file (config.json or .env).

> psql -U your-username -p 5433 -c "CREATE DATABASE pneuservice_db;"

### 3. Configure the Environment

Set up the necessary environment variables for both the front-end and back-end. These variables include database connection details and server ports.

### 4. Install Dependencies

### 5. Start the Application

- Backend (API Server): 
  Run the following command from the `backend` folder:
> npm run start

- Frontend (UI Server): 
  Run the following command from the `frontend` folder, ensuring the UI is served on port 4200:
  > ng serve --port 4200
  
### 6. Access the Application

- UI: The frontend can be accessed at `http://localhost:4200`.
- API: The API server can be accessed on the port specified during setup (default: `http://localhost:8081`).
